#Greedy

Selecting the best way on present situation

Question 1:

first input: input 3 variables
each means size of array, the number of numbers(maybe integer) to add, maximum add iterations with same number.

second input: Enter as many numbers as the number of variables previously entered

Here's example
input: 
4 6 2
2 4 3 5 4

result: 28(5+5+4+5+5+4)

this result means we can add the maximum number as much as maximum add iterations. then, we add second largest number once.
and then add max number again.
so we can get that result.

Solution 1)

we need some steps for solving this problems.
1. use dynamic array for control input numbers
2. sort array(ascending or decending) for to find the maximum and the next larger
3. implement according to the rules
